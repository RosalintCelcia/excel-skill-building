## ✅ What I Learned:

   - Applied **Percentage (%) format**  
   - Used **Accounting, Currency, and General formats**  
   - Reset with **General format** to clear all number formatting  
✔️ Understood how number formatting:  
   - Speeds up **data entry**  
   - **Changes display only** (not the underlying values)  
   - Does not affect formulas (they see the raw values)  
✔️ Explored **Date & Time Number Formatting**  
✔️ Built a **Payroll Template** and calculated:  
   - **Basic payroll** using time and rates  
   - **Days left for invoices**  
   - **Time proportion of 1 day = 24 hours**  
✔️ Worked with **Date Functions**:  
   - **EDATE & EOMONTH** for monthly shifts  
   - **Day calculations & Date math**

## 🛠️ Practice Activities:  
- Designed a **mini payroll calculator** using time and date functions

## 📒 Notes:  
- **Formatting only changes the appearance**, not the actual value stored in Excel  
- **Serial numbers** are the backbone of Excel’s date and time system  
- Combining **number formatting + date functions** makes professional templates possible

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:  
Excel formatting and date functions are more than just visuals — they are essential for building **accurate financial models, payroll systems, and professional reports**. Understanding that formatting doesn’t change the raw value helps avoid common mistakes in analysis.
