# 📊 Excel Skill Building – Day 12  

## 📘 Topics Covered:
On Day 12 of my Excel learning journey, I explored **conditional calculations and advanced logical functions**. Here's what I learned and practiced:

---

## ✅ What I Learned:
✔️ Performed **calculations with multiple conditions or criteria**  
✔️ Applied **MAXIFS** and **MINIFS** to find maximum and minimum values based on conditions  
✔️ Used **COUNTIFS** for counting with multiple criteria  
✔️ Explored **Excel Table feature** to simplify formulas with **structured references**  
✔️ Practiced **SUMIFS** for conditional sums, including:  
   - SUMIFS with relative and absolute cell references  
   - SUMIFS with two conditions  
✔️ Created **COUNTIFS with 3 conditions** for complex filtering  
✔️ Applied **AVERAGEIFS** with two conditions for targeted averages  
✔️ Integrated **AND logical tests** inside formulas for validation

## 🛠️ Practice Activities:
🔹 Solved 3 practical problems combining multiple functions  
🔹 Built conditional reports using SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, and AVERAGEIFS  
🔹 Tested formulas with both **relative and absolute cell references** for flexibility  
🔹 Applied functions in parallel to understand similarities and differences

## 📒 Notes:
- All practice files and notes are included in this repository.  
- File names follow clear naming conventions for quick reference.  
- Functions were tested across **sample sales, student marks, and employee datasets**.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- **IFS functions** (SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, MAXIFS, MINIFS, AVERAGEIFS) make Excel extremely powerful for **conditional analysis**.  
- Using **tables + structured references** simplifies formulas and makes them easier to scale.  
- Practicing with multiple criteria builds confidence in solving **real-world analytical problems**.
