# 📊 Excel Skill Building – Day 8

## 📘 Topics Covered:
On Day 8 of my Excel learning journey, I explored a mix of **formulas, text handling, logical functions, and practice problems**. Here's what I focused on:

---

## ✅ What I Learned:
✔️ **Number Formulas** – applied basic arithmetic and numerical functions  
✔️ **Text Formulas** – formatted and manipulated text values in cells  
✔️ **Logical Formulas** – practiced IF and IS functions for decision-making  
✔️ **Formula Elements** – understood cell references, operators, and order of precedence  
✔️ **Join Operations** – combined text strings effectively  
✔️ **RIGHT Function** – extracted characters from the end of a string  
✔️ **LEFT Function** – extracted characters from the beginning of a string  
✔️ **IF Function** – applied conditional logic to return customized results  
✔️ **IS Functions** – validated cell content (e.g., ISNUMBER, ISTEXT, ISBLANK)  
✔️ **Checkbook Formula** – applied formulas to balance transactions  
✔️ **Text Strings** – managed string-based values inside formulas  
✔️ **Zero-Length Text String** – handled `""` to return blanks in logical conditions  
✔️ **Comparative Operators** – used `=, >, <, >=, <=, <>` in formulas for comparisons

## 🛠️ Practice Activities:
- Solved **9 structured problems** combining number, text, and logical formulas  
- Practiced **RIGHT & LEFT functions** for extracting codes and IDs  
- Built a **checkbook-style balance tracker** using IF + arithmetic formulas  
- Applied **comparative operators** to evaluate sales thresholds and pass/fail logic  
- Tested **zero-length text strings** to return blanks instead of "0" or error messages

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:
- **Formulas are the backbone of Excel** – mastering text, number, and logical operations creates a strong foundation.  
- **RIGHT, LEFT, IF, and IS functions** are practical in real-world data cleaning and reporting.  
- Using **comparative operators + zero-length text strings** makes results cleaner and easier to interpret.
