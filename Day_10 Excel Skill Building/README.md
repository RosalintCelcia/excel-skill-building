On Day 10 of my Excel learning journey, I focused on mastering **Excel Table Features** and **Mixed Cell References** for practical financial and analytical use cases. Here's what I learned and practiced:  

## ✅ What I Learned:
✔️ Used **Excel Table Feature** to easily add extra rows and columns without breaking references  
✔️ Set **Approximate Match in VLOOKUP** tables within Excel Tables  
✔️ Observed how tables automatically **update formulas when new features/fields are added**  
✔️ Explored **structured setup for adding new rows and columns** efficiently  
✔️ Built **Pivot Tables directly from Excel Tables** for dynamic reporting

   2. Sledgehammer Method (lock cells forcefully)  
   3. Highlight multiple cells and apply formula in one click  

## 🛠️ Practice Activities:
- Practiced **6 problem sets** covering Excel Table features and mixed references
