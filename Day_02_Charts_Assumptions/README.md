# 📈 Day 2 – Excel Formulas, Charts & Assumption Tables
 
🎯 **Goal:** Understand the structure of Excel formulas and build interactive visualizations with dynamic inputs.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered:
- The **Golden Rule** of Excel formulas
- Formula input best practices (using `=`, selecting cells, not hardcoding values)
- Creating and formatting **Column Charts**
- Formatting **chart elements** like axes, data labels, and colors
- Changing **chart titles dynamically** using cell references instead of typing manually
- Building an **Assumption Table (Formula Input Table)** to make the workbook responsive
  - When values in the input table are changed, all related formulas and charts update automatically 💡

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced:
- Used formulas with clear input cells
- Created a formatted bar chart with a dynamic title
- Tested how changing assumptions affected outputs across the sheet

## 📁 Files Included:
- `Day2_AssumptionTable_Chart.xlsx`: Workbook showing dynamic inputs and chart
- Screenshot of Excel Workbook
- Screenshot of Page Setup of Excel Workbook

## 💬 Reflections:
This was a very **interactive and insightful session**. The concept of an assumption table was new to me, but it's clearly a powerful way to organize spreadsheets and make them scalable. Also loved how using a cell for the chart title can save so much time!
