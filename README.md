## 📈 Why This Challenge?

Excel is often underestimated, but it’s a foundational tool for:
- Cleaning and exploring data
- Creating dashboards and reports
- Performing basic to intermediate analysis
- Building confidence before diving into SQL, Python, and BI tools

This challenge is my way to build that foundation — with consistency, clarity, and hands-on practice.
