## ✅ What I Learned:  

### 1. Data Analysis Feature  
✔️ Explored the built-in Data Analysis tools for handling datasets efficiently.  

### 2. Flash Fill  
✔️ Used **Flash Fill** to automatically detect patterns and fill data.  
✔️ Saved time by reducing manual data entry.  

### 3. Filter Features  
- 3.1 ✔️ **Hide rows** that were not required for analysis.  
- 3.2 ✔️ **Copy & Paste** filtered rows to extract specific subsets of data.  

### 4. Sorting Data  
- 4.1 ✔️ **Sort by a single column** for quick organization.  
- 4.2 ✔️ Ensured sorting was applied to the **entire dataset** (not breaking data relationships).  
- 4.3 ✔️ Applied **multi-column sorting** for deeper insights.  
- 4.4 ✔️ Performed **major sorting** using both the **dialog box** and quick **sort buttons**.  

### 5. Practice Activities  
✔️ Solved **4 practice problems** that involved applying all the above features in parallel while learning.  
✔️ Reinforced concepts by cleaning and organizing datasets multiple times.

## 📒 Notes:  
- Practice files and problem solutions are included in this repository.  
- Each problem is clearly labeled for easy reference.  
- Tried multiple approaches (buttons vs. dialog box) to compare methods.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:  
- **Flash Fill** is a powerful shortcut when dealing with repetitive text patterns.  
- Using **Filters + Sorting** together helps extract meaningful subsets of data quickly.  
- Always sort the **entire dataset** to prevent mismatched rows and errors.  
- Hands-on practice across multiple problems builds confidence in applying these features in real-world scenarios.
