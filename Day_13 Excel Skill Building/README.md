# 📊 Excel Skill Building – Day 13

## 📘 Topics Covered:
On Day 13 of my Excel learning journey, I explored advanced Pivot Table features and powerful value analysis techniques. Here's what I learned and practiced:

---

## ✅ What I Learned:
✔️ Built **cross-tabulated reports** and applied **Show Values As → % of Row** for better comparison  
✔️ Worked with a **single text column** to get a **unique list count** and calculate **% distribution**  
✔️ Created a **VLOOKUP-based column**, then built **two Pivot Tables** using that column and added a **shared slicer**  
✔️ Successfully **connected a slicer to multiple Pivot Tables** for synchronized filtering  
✔️ Practiced the **Group By feature** in Pivot Tables to organize data into meaningful categories  
✔️ Used **Show Values As** for:  
   - Month-over-Month change  
   - % change  
   - Running total analysis  
✔️ Applied **Summarize Values By** feature to aggregate data differently (Sum, Count, Average, etc.)  
✔️ Solved **2 practice problems**, each with **2 sub-problems**, applying all the above features in parallel while learning

## 🛠️ Practice Activities:
- Designed reports comparing **row percentages** with cross-tab tables  
- Built dashboards using **unique counts** and **VLOOKUP-powered fields**  
- Created **multi-Pivot Table interactivity** with slicers  
- Tested grouping, running totals, and dynamic summaries on multiple datasets

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:
Pivot Tables are not just for summarizing — with **Show Values As, Summarize Values By, and slicer connections**, they become dynamic tools for **trend analysis, interactive reporting, and advanced comparisons**.
