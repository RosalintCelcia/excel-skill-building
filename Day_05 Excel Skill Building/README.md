On Day 5 of my Excel learning journey, I focused on **Advanced Pivot Table Techniques** and interactive data analysis. Here's what I learned and practiced:

### ✅ What I Learned:
- ✔️ Created **cross-tabulated reports** using Pivot Tables with **two conditions** (rows and columns)
- ✔️ Used **Filters** in Pivot Tables to dynamically change the view
- ✔️ Understood default behavior:
  - Text fields → added to **Values** area → defaults to **Count**
  - Number fields → added to **Values** area → defaults to **Sum**
- ✔️ Inserted **Slicers** to add interactivity
- ✔️ Combined **Pivot Table + Filter + Slicer** for reports based on **three criteria**

## 🛠️ Practice Activities:
